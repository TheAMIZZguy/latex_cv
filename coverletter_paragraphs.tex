%     I am writing to express my interest in the \positionview\ position at \companynameview, as advertised. Currently a 4th year Honours student in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of British Columbia, I have developed a keen interest and expertise in data science, algorithm design, and software development. These skills, combined with my experience in technology and finance, align perfectly with the dynamic and challenging environment of Macquarie.\\
    
%     During my tenure as a Junior Data Scientist at the UBC Data Science Institute, I honed my analytical skills, particularly in NLP processes and cancer prediction using medical reports. This role required a deep understanding of complex data sets and the ability to develop innovative solutions - skills directly applicable to understanding the secondary market for pre-IPO securities at Macquarie. Furthermore, my experience as a Technology Transformation Analyst at Citigroup has given me a solid grounding in financial technologies and control validations, enhancing my ability to contribute meaningfully to your platform's transaction volume and adoption.\\
    
%     My varied job roles have also afforded me the opportunity to develop a mix of soft and technical skills. I am adept at communicating complex technical concepts to diverse audiences, a skill I enhanced while serving as a Teaching Assistant and Tutor at UBC. This experience will be invaluable in facilitating transactions and assisting parties to achieve closing, as required by the role.\\
    
%     I am particularly drawn to Macquarie due to its position as a pioneer in the fintech/marketplace sector. The opportunity to be part of a team that is revolutionizing the trading platform for shares in private late-stage venture-capital backed companies is exactly the kind of challenge I seek. I am eager to bring my analytical passion, software development expertise, and interest for fintech to contribute to Macquarie's growth and success.\\
    
%     Enclosed is my resume, which provides further details of my qualifications. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you. Thank you for considering my application.
